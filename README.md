# My New Tab

## Presentation 

This project comes originally from my dotfiles, it is a startpage written in svelte that allows a bit of customisation,
it is licensed under GPLv3.

## Install

Currently, you can only install it by building it from scratch and then manually enabling the unpackaged extension in chrome.

## Build 

You need nodejs 14.x or above and npm to manage dependencies, other versions are untested.
Inside the project root folder, run `npm i` to install dependencies and `npm run build` to build the startpage.
The result is located in the public folder.

## Developpment

after installing dependencies, use `npm run dev` to enable the local server.
